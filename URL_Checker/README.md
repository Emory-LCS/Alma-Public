into lines compatible with turbo_url_alma.pl .  The CSV file contains URLs from ALMA portfolios and URLs from ALMA bibliographic records.

**checkurl_mailing_list.txt** is a configuration file that turbo_url_alma.pl expects to send email messages with failed
URLs. turbo_url_alma.pl separates ALMA portfolio URLs from ALMA bibliographic URLs when sending email messages.Ã¥
